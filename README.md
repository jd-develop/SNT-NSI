# SNT/NSI/MP2I code
 All the code I wrote in SNT, NSI, MP2I and MPI computer science classes.

# Languages and dependencies
## Python
Some code is written in Python.

All code in [SNT/Python/2022-03/](SNT/Python/2022-03/) needs `pillow`
(`pip install pillow`). Note that pillow is installed by default in Anaconda.

## Python for Processing 4
Some code (`*.pyde` files, in the `sketch_*` folders in
[NSI/première/processing](NSI/première/processing)) is written in
[Python](https://py.processing.org), but needs
[Processing 4](https://processing.org) to be executed.

## C and Ocaml
Some parts (in the [MP2I/](MP2I/) and [MPI/](MPI/) folders) require C and
[Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/)
