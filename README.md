# SNT/NSI code
 All my code written in SNT and NSI classes in all my schooling, as well as MP2I computer science classes.

# Languages and dependencies
## Python
Some code is written in Python.

All code in [SNT/Python/2022-03/](SNT/Python/2022-03/) needs `pillow` (`pip install pillow`). Note that pillow is installed by default in Anaconda.

## Python for Processing 4
Some code (`*.pyde` files, in the `sketch_*` folders in [NSI/première/processing](NSI/première/processing)) is written in [Python](https://py.processing.org), but needs [Processing 4](https://processing.org) to be executed.

## C and Ocaml
Some code will require C and [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/)
